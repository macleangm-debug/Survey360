<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user wants to build a complex data collection platform named DataPulse.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- The platform should be built with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database.
- It must support Single Sign-On (SSO) and integrate with an existing project under Software Galaxy. The user provided an OpenID configuration URL: .
- The core functionality should not be dependent on AI.
- Key features include: a Bento grid dashboard, a spreadsheet-style form builder, organization and project management, data submission and browsing, case management, data export, and user management.
- The UI should be redesigned to incorporate DataVision brand colors (Red, Navy Blue, Gray) in a subtle, professional manner, with high contrast for visibility, while retaining the original DataPulse logo.
- Implement the Cases page for longitudinal tracking, a detailed Quality Dashboard, and a Settings page for user preferences.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack web application, DataPulse, has been successfully built and deployed. The backend is powered by FastAPI with MongoDB, and the frontend is built with React and .

The application is fully functional, with core features implemented and verified:
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based login/registration and SSO integration readiness.
-   **Core Pages:** Login, Dashboard, Projects, a drag-and-drop Form Builder, Submissions viewer, and Team management pages are all functional.
-   **UI:** The application features a professional dark theme. Following several user-requested revisions, the UI now subtly incorporates the DataVision brand colors as accents while maintaining high text visibility and contrast. The original DataPulse logo is used.
-   **Testing:** All existing backend and frontend functionalities have passed automated tests.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was about to begin implementation of three new pages based on the user's latest request:
    1.  **Cases page:** For tracking respondents across multiple survey visits.
    2.  **Quality Dashboard:** A page with detailed data quality metrics.
    3.  **Settings page:** For managing user and organization preferences.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? both
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues or bugs. The agent's last work was to start a new set of features.

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: **Implement New Feature Pages (P0)**
    -   Where to resume: The agent needs to start creating the new pages and their corresponding backend logic.
        1.  Create frontend page components: , , and .
        2.  Update the frontend router in  to include these new pages.
        3.  Add navigation links for these pages in the sidebar component: .
        4.  Create new backend API endpoints if necessary to support the functionality of these pages.
    -   What will be achieved with this? This will complete the feature set requested by the user, adding capabilities for longitudinal data tracking, advanced quality monitoring, and user customization.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? both
    -   Blocked on something: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other upcoming or future tasks mentioned beyond the current implementation of the Cases, Quality, and Settings pages.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Full-Stack Application Development:** Created the DataPulse platform from scratch.
    -   **Backend (FastAPI):** Implemented all necessary models and API routes for authentication, organizations, projects, forms, submissions, and team management. (/app/backend/main.py, /app/backend/models/, /app/backend/routes/)
    -   **Frontend (React):** Built a complete user interface with .
        -   Implemented all core pages: Login, Dashboard, Projects, Form Builder, Submissions, Team. (/app/frontend/src/App.js, /app/frontend/src/pages/)
-   **UI/UX Redesign:**
    -   Performed an initial redesign to incorporate DataVision brand colors (Chat 139).
    -   Refined the design to be more subtle and professional based on user feedback (Chat 156).
    -   Fixed all visibility and text contrast issues in the dark theme across the application (Chat 167, 182).
-   **Functionality Verification:** Confirmed that all implemented pages and features are working correctly through both automated testing and manual verification with screenshots.
-   **Documentation:** Created a Product Requirements Document ().

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:** Linter warnings in  components.
    -   Debug checklist: Running  in the  directory shows warnings related to pre-existing code within the  library components.
    -   Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? Fixing these is low priority. They are warnings, not errors, and do not affect functionality. Ignoring them for now is acceptable to focus on feature implementation.
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: frontend
    -   Is recurring issue? Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   No previous forks exist for this job.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Python
-   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, , , 
-   **Database:** MongoDB (via  async driver)
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), SSO (OpenID Connect integration planned)
-   **Architecture:** Multi-tenant REST API with a single-page application (SPA) frontend.

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** {email, hashed_password, full_name}
-   **organizations:** {name, owner_id}
-   **org_members:** {org_id, user_id, role}
-   **projects:** {name, org_id}
-   **forms:** {name, project_id, fields, version}
-   **submissions:** {form_id, data, submitted_by, status}
-   **cases:** {respondent_id, project_id, status}

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Main FastAPI application entry point.
-   : Main React component defining routes and layout.
-   : Global stylesheet with theme variables and custom styles.
-   : Defines the primary navigation structure.
-   : Handles user login and registration UI.
-   : The main landing page after login.
-   : The Product Requirements Document created by the agent.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The linter warnings within the  directory (from ) could be addressed in the future for better code hygiene, but they are not critical.

**key api endpoints**
-   , 
-   
-   
-   
-   
-    (for team management)
-   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly focused on UI/UX. Pay close attention to visual details, including color usage, branding consistency, and text visibility.
-   The UI theme should remain professional and subtle. The DataVision colors (Red: , Navy: ) should only be used as accents.
-   Always keep the original DataPulse logo. Do not replace it.
-   The next set of tasks is to build three new pages: Cases, Quality Dashboard, and Settings. Ensure they are integrated seamlessly into the existing navigation and UI theme.
