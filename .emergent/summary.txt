**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The Survey360 application is a feature-rich, full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. In this session, the following major features were added:
-   **Reusable **: A new, feature-rich header has been implemented and integrated, including search, help, theme toggle, notifications, and a user menu.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**: A complete, reusable i18n system supporting 6 languages (English, Spanish, French, Swahili, Portuguese, Arabic) with RTL support has been integrated. A  component was created and added to the header.
-   **Link Shortening**: A backend service using TinyURL was created to shorten survey links. The frontend  on the surveys list page was updated to use this feature.
-   **Fully Interactive Demo**: The static demo page was transformed into a fully interactive sandbox, featuring a Try Survey mode, live response simulation, and interactive charts.
-   **New P2 Features**:
    -   **Excel Export**: Users can now export survey responses as an Excel file.
    -   **Survey Scheduling**: A UI and backend endpoint exist to schedule surveys (start/end dates).
    -   **Email Invitations**: A UI and backend endpoint were created to send email invitations. This currently uses a placeholder and requires integration with an email service like Resend.
-   **Code for **: The agent generated reusable code for a comprehensive share dialog as requested.

**Last working item**:
The user requested a way to implement a user manual to reduce the need for human support and chose Option D - Use screenshots for now from the agent's proposal.

- **Last item agent was working**: Planning the implementation of a comprehensive user manual/documentation suite with screenshots.
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: After creating the documentation page/component and integrating it, the agent should use the screenshot tool to verify it's accessible and displays the content correctly. A link to the manual should be added to the Help menu in the .
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The focus is on implementing new features.

**In progress Task List**:

- **Task 1: Implement User Manual / Documentation Suite** (P0 - HIGHEST)
    - **Where to resume**: Create a new page or a large modal component to house the documentation. It should be structured with clear sections (e.g., Getting Started, Creating a Survey, Analyzing Responses) and include screenshots as requested by the user. Add a link to this manual in the 's help dropdown.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A self-service help resource for users, reducing the need for direct support.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.
    - **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
  - **P1: Implement QR Code Generation:** The  has a tab for a QR code, but the generation logic is a placeholder. This requires installing a library like  and implementing the generation and download functionality.
  - **P1: Implement Resend Integration:** The Email Invitations feature is currently a placeholder. Integrate the Resend email service to make it functional. This will require using the  subagent.
  - **P2: Apply i18n Translations**: The i18n infrastructure is in place, but the text across the application has not been updated to use the  hook. All static text should be moved to the  translation files.
- **Future Tasks**:
  - **P2: Team Collaboration:** (From PRD) Implement features allowing multiple users to collaborate on surveys.
  - **P2: Add more Advanced Analytics & Reporting:** (From PRD)
  - **P3: Add 3rd party integrations like Zapier and Mailchimp:** (From PRD)
  - **P3: Refactor public-facing pages** (, ) to use the centralized theme and i18n systems for full-app consistency.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The issue regarding the interactivity of the demo screen was resolved in this session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, , .
- **Internationalization**: , .
- **Backend**: FastAPI,  for external API calls.
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Data Handling**:  for Excel generation.

**key DB schema**
- No direct schema changes were confirmed, but the implementation of Survey Scheduling implies new fields might be needed in the  collection (e.g., , , ).

**changes in tech stack**
- **Backend**: Added  for making API calls to TinyURL.  was already present but is now actively used.
- **Frontend**: Added , ,  for internationalization.

**All files of reference**
- **Created Files**:
  - : Utility for shortening URLs via TinyURL.
  - : Core configuration file for the i18n library.
  - : Translation files for 6 languages.
  - : Reusable language switcher component.
  - : Reusable dialog for sharing surveys.
- **Updated Files**:
  - : Added endpoints for URL shortening, Excel export, scheduling, and email invites.
  - : Replaced hardcoded language dropdown with the reusable  component.
  - : Integrated new modals for scheduling, email invites, and the Excel export handler. Updated the share dialog to include the link shortener.
  - : Overhauled to make it fully interactive.
  - : Initialized the i18n service.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The Email Invitations feature relies on placeholder logic. It needs to be refactored to use a real email integration (e.g., Resend).

**key api endpoints**
-  (POST): Shortens a given URL.
-  (GET): Downloads survey responses as an Excel file.
-  (POST): Schedules a survey's start and end times.
-  (POST): Sends email invitations (currently a placeholder).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The immediate priority is to implement the user manual as a comprehensive, screenshot-rich documentation suite.
- The user is highly collaborative and often provides detailed code or clear instructions. Follow them closely.
- The i18n system is fully set up but has not been applied to the application's UI text. New features and refactoring should use the  function for all user-facing strings.
- The email invitation feature is a mock. The next logical step after the user manual would be to integrate a service like Resend to make it functional.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- : Updated to reflect newly completed features.
