<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initiated a series of feature requests and improvements for a data analysis platform named DataPulse. The requests evolved over the session:
1.  **UI Fix**: Resolve poor contrast and visibility issues for UI elements, especially cards, in the application's dark mode.
2.  **UI/UX Refactor**:
    *   Move the Online status indicator from the bottom of the sidebar to the top.
    *   Place the status indicator within a dropdown that contains quick links to various parts of the application.
    *   Enhance the Settings page by adding multiple new sections/tabs for a more comprehensive user configuration experience (Profile, Appearance, Security, Privacy, etc.).
3.  **Statistical Features**:
    *   Implement a UI for configuring and running replicate weight analyses (BRR/jackknife).
    *   Enhance the AI Copilot to provide better evidence-linked narratives in its output.
    *   Add support for Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions, including interaction terms, in the backend.
4.  **New Feature**: Introduce a Quick Analysis wizard to guide users in selecting the appropriate statistical test based on their data and research goals.
5.  **Code Refactoring**:
    *   Refactor the monolithic backend statistics route file () into a modular structure.
    *   Refactor the large frontend component () into smaller, more manageable child components.
6.  **Robustness and Scalability**: Implement significant backend improvements to handle large datasets and high traffic, including background job processing (Celery/Redis), cursor-based data loading, rate limiting, and streaming exports.
7.  **Product Extraction**: Extract a new, focused, and standalone application named Survey360 from the existing DataPulse codebase. This new application should have its own branding and be deployable independently.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The primary application, DataPulse, is a feature-rich, full-stack data analysis platform. It has a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The backend has been significantly hardened with a background job queue (Celery/Redis), rate limiting, and paginated data loaders to ensure scalability. The frontend and backend codebases were recently refactored for better maintainability.

The agent has just begun the process of extracting the Survey360 application. A new project directory  has been created. This directory contains the initial setup for a standalone React/Vite application, including , configuration files (, ), and the basic  and . The agent has also copied over some UI components from DataPulse and created a new landing page () for Survey360.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was in the process of creating the new standalone application, Survey360. After setting up the initial project structure and configuration, it created the  file for the new application.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The sole focus is the in-progress task of creating the Survey360 application.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Complete the extraction of the Survey360 application (Priority: P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent has just created the landing page at . The next steps are:
        1.  Copy and adapt the necessary shared components from the DataPulse project (, , etc.) into the  directory.
        2.  Re-create or adapt the core feature components required for Survey360, such as the Form Builder, Submissions Dashboard, and survey-related settings pages.
        3.  Set up the application routing ( or similar) to connect the landing page, login, dashboard, and other pages.
        4.  Filter out features from DataPulse that are not relevant to Survey360 (e.g., advanced statistical analysis, complex regression models).
        5.  Ensure the new application can be built and run independently.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A complete, standalone Survey360 frontend application, ready for deployment.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: The backend for Survey360 has not been defined or created yet. The next agent needs to clarify if it should use the existing DataPulse backend or if a new, separate backend instance needs to be set up.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   (P1) **Setup Backend for Survey360**: Based on the user's request for a completely standalone app with separate deployment, a separate backend will be required. This involves copying the DataPulse backend, removing unnecessary APIs (e.g., advanced stats), and configuring it for a new deployment.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **Extract StatsPro Product**: As discussed during the extraction strategy, create another standalone application focused on advanced statistics.
    -   **Extract FieldOps Product**: Create a product focused on field operations and data collection logistics.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Dark Mode UI Fix**: Fixed contrast issues across the application by replacing hardcoded colors with TailwindCSS theme variables (, , etc.). Verified fixes on Projects, Forms, Dashboard, and Data Analysis pages.

**All files of reference**
-   **Key New Files (Survey360)**:
    -   : Defines the new project's dependencies and scripts.
    -   : Build configuration for the new frontend app.
    -   : Entry point for the Survey360 React app.
    -   : The newly created landing page for Survey360.
-   **Key New/Refactored Files (DataPulse)**:
    -   : Directory containing modularized statistics endpoints.
    -   : New endpoint for querying background job status.
    -   , : Celery configuration.
    -   , : Core robustness utilities.
    -   : Directory containing refactored frontend components.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The new  project is being built by copying files from . Care must be taken to remove unused props, logic, and dependencies to keep the new codebase lean and maintainable.

**key api endpoints**
-   : New modular statistics endpoints.
-   : New endpoint to get the status of a background job.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user has explicitly requested that **Survey360 be a completely standalone app with separate deployment.**
-   The agent has only started building the **standalone frontend**.
-   The **backend for Survey360 does not exist yet**. The next agent's first major task, after completing the frontend skeleton, will be to create this separate backend. This will likely involve duplicating the DataPulse backend, stripping out non-essential APIs, and configuring it for a separate deployment and database connection. This is a critical distinction from the agent's initial plan of sharing a backend.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   : The Product Requirements Document was updated multiple times throughout the session to reflect completed work and new tasks.
