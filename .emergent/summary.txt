<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a new, simplified product called Survey360 by extracting relevant features from an existing, more complex product named DataPulse. The initial requirement was to remove unnecessary features rather than adding new ones, and to use a separate database for data isolation.

Later, the user requested to embed the Survey360 application's login/register functionality within a specific marketing page () on the DataVision International website, allowing users to access the full Survey360 application after authentication.

Finally, after the basic integration was complete, the user confirmed that the agent should implement all remaining features to make Survey360 a fully functional, standalone product that clients can use. This includes a working survey builder, public forms for response collection, and connecting all UI components to real backend data.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
Survey360 is now integrated into the primary  monorepo. It does not use a separate backend; its API routes are merged into the main FastAPI backend under the  prefix to simplify deployment and avoid CORS issues. The frontend is integrated into the main React application, accessible under the  path.

The application currently has:
- A landing page at .
- Functional user authentication (Login/Register) using a separate authentication state ( store) from the main DataPulse app.
- A dashboard that displays real-time statistics (survey count, response count) from the database.
- A fully functional Survey Builder UI that allows creating surveys with 10 different question types.
- A public-facing page () for respondents to view and fill out surveys.
- Backend endpoints to support creating, publishing, fetching, and submitting surveys and responses.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was performing an end-to-end test of the complete survey lifecycle. It had successfully created a survey using the builder, published it, and loaded the public-facing form. The final step was to submit a test response to this form to verify that the data is saved correctly and reflected in the Responses page of the application.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** manual testing by curl. The agent should first submit a response via the public survey form. Then, it should log in to the Survey360 dashboard, navigate to the Responses tab for that survey, and verify that the submitted response is displayed. It should also check if the statistics on the main dashboard have updated correctly.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** The authentication flow was complex to debug, involving multiple refactors. The current solution uses two separate Zustand stores that persist to different keys in local storage. While it works, any future authentication changes should be handled carefully to avoid regressions.
    *   **Status:** RESOLVED
    *   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1:** Complete End-to-End Survey Functionality Test (P0)
    *   **Where to resume:** Resume the test from Chat Message #285. A public survey form is open. The next step is to fill out the form and click Submit.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** This will confirm that the core product loop is functional: a user can create a survey, a respondent can submit a response, and the creator can view that response.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    *   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1:** Implement Data Export Functionality (P1)
        *   The Export button on the Responses page is currently a placeholder. This task involves implementing the backend logic to generate a CSV or Excel file of survey responses and wiring it to the frontend button.
        *   Files to modify: , .
    *   **Task 2:** Refine Survey List Page (P2)
        *   The  page should have functional Publish/Unpublish toggles and accurate links to the builder, settings, and public survey URL.
        *   Files to modify: .

*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1:** Code Simplification and Cleanup (P2)
        *   As per the original request, the agent should perform a pass to identify and remove any leftover  code, components, or styles that are not required for , ensuring a lean and focused codebase.

**Code Architecture**
The project is a monorepo containing a single FastAPI backend and a single React frontend.
-   **Backend ():** A main FastAPI application that now serves both  and  APIs. Survey360 endpoints are organized under a dedicated router with the prefix .
-   **Frontend ():** A single React application using Vite.  is implemented as a set of pages and components within this app, accessible via routes under . React Router handles the routing.
-   **State Management:** Zustand is used for global state. Two separate auth stores ( and ) are used to manage authentication for  and  independently, persisting to different keys in local storage.

**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (with Motor for async access), Pydantic.
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components.
-   **State Management:** Zustand with  middleware for local storage synchronization.
-   **Architecture:** Integrated application model where a new product () is embedded within an existing application's frontend and backend, sharing the same infrastructure but maintaining logical separation through routing and state management.

**key DB schema**
The application uses MongoDB, which is schema-less. However, the Pydantic models in the backend define the structure for:
-   : uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , ,  (draft/published), .
-   : uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), ,  (e.g., 'short_text', 'rating'), .
-   : uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , .
-    & : Standard user and organization models for authentication.

**All files of reference**
-   : Main FastAPI app file, modified to include the Survey360 API router and startup event.
-   : Directory containing all backend API routes for Survey360 (auth, surveys, responses, public).
-   : Contains logic to create a demo user for Survey360 on application startup.
-   : Main frontend router, updated with all routes for the Survey360 application.
-   : Directory containing all React components for Survey360 pages (Dashboard, Login, Builder, etc.).
-   : The public-facing form for respondents.
-   : The dedicated Axios instance for making API calls to the Survey360 backend endpoints.
-   : The Zustand store for managing Survey360's authentication state, separate from the main app's auth.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The initial strategy of a separate backend for Survey360 was abandoned. All backend logic is now merged into the main FastAPI application. Do not attempt to create a separate backend service.
-   Authentication for Survey360 is handled completely separately from the main  application. It uses its own Zustand store () and its own local storage key (). All authenticated API calls must use the token from this specific store.
-   All frontend routes for Survey360 are prefixed with . The public-facing survey page is an exception, with the route .

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   : Updated to reflect the completion of the Survey360 extraction and feature implementation.
